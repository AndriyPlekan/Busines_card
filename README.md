# Busines_card
This is a business card website for Plekan Andriy.

It is a long landing page, which has 4 main sections:

1. Header with a main photo, button and some text
2. 'Portfolio' section with 3 pictures of the projects. After clicking on the photo the new section appears with a description of the project and a photo.
3. 'About' section with some information about me: First years at school, First steps at the university and Dance life.
4. 'Contact' section with a form containing 'Name', 'Email', 'Phone" and 'Message' fields.

This landing page has a navbar with links to 3 sections of the page. After changing the dimension of the screen, the navbar transforms to burger menu.
Also the page has a footer, where icons with links to social media pages and other information are.

To build this project html5, css, javascript was used, as well as bootstrap 4 elements, such as navigation panel and portfolio section.
I aslo used bootstrap grid to make this website.
